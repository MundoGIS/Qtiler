# Contribution Guide

Thanks for your interest in Qtiler! This document explains how to collaborate with the project and how to financially support its development.

## Before contributing code
- Review the open issues to check whether your idea is already being discussed.
- Explain the problem you solve and why the change is necessary.
- All contributions must be compatible with the project license (MPL 2.0). By submitting code you confirm you can license it under those terms.

## Recommended workflow
1. **Fork & branch:** fork the repository and work on a descriptive feature branch.
2. **Discuss first:** for large changes, open an issue to align expectations before coding.
3. **Standards:** follow the existing structure, add short comments only when the intent is non-obvious, and update any relevant docs.
4. **Testing:** run the applicable tests and include the results in your pull request.
5. **Pull request:** describe the context, the changes, and known limitations. Add screenshots when the UI is affected.

## Bug reports and feature requests
- Provide reproduction steps, sample data, and the expected behavior.
- If the issue involves sensitive information, email us privately so we can investigate securely.

## Plugins and extensions
- The Qtiler core is open source, and we welcome both free and commercial plugins built by the community.
- Document the APIs you use and share technical notes that help us review your work.
- To list your plugin in the official catalog, open an issue labeled `plugin` and include documentation links.

## Donations and sponsorship
- We accept individual donations and corporate sponsorships to fund infrastructure, community support, and roadmap work.
- Contact **abel.gonzalez@mundogis.se** with the subject "Qtiler Donation" to coordinate transfers, invoices, or public acknowledgments.
